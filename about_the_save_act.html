    <h1>About the SAVE Act</h1>
    <p>
        The SAVE Act, introduced by Rep. Chip Roy and Sen. Mike Lee, is a critical piece of legislation aimed at ensuring the integrity of U.S. elections by requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.

        “In order to preserve this republic, we must uphold what it means to be able to vote in a U.S. election,” emphasized Rep. Chip Roy. “I am grateful that my colleagues answered the call and passed the SAVE Act,” he continued, describing this as the “critical first step to ensure that we maintain election integrity throughout our country.”

        Speaker Johnson warned that audits in several states have already uncovered non-citizens on voter rolls, calling it a “serious and immediate problem.” Johnson made clear this is not just policy—it’s principle.

        “We must make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,” he added. “That’s what the SAVE Act would do.”

        “Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and protecting them from foreign influence is non-negotiable,” Republican Study Committee Chairman August Pfluger (R-TX) said in a statement.

        “It’s common sense that only American citizens should vote in our elections. You need ID to board a plane or open a bank account—voting deserves the same standard. I applaud RSC member Rep. Chip Roy on leading the charge to get this over the finish line,” Pfluger added.

        "It doesn't matter whether you're Republican or Democrat — only U.S. citizens should decide U.S. elections," Johnson said.

        "That is current federal law, but the problem is, right now, we have no mechanism to ensure that non-citizens aren't participating. All these millions of illegals who have flooded over that open border since the border czar, [Vice President] Kamala Harris, and [President] Joe Biden opened it, many of them are signing up to vote and we can't allow them to taint the election.

        "So, this is our last opportunity to require proof of citizenship for someone to participate in the election cycle. We have at least six or seven states that have already done audits and proven they have non-citizens on the rolls. It's a serious and immediate problem, and Congress has to address it. And we're going to do that today."

        This is the principled position. It's what we're required to do — to do everything within our power to secure that election.

        "I've been traveling nonstop. I've done campaign events in over 205 cities now, in 40 states so far. Every public forum, without exception, the first or second question from the audience is, 'Can we count on the integrity of the election?' This is a big, big thing," Johnson said.

        A report from Johnson warned of a National Voter Registration Act “loophole” in which states do not ask for proof of citizenship when registering an individual to vote in federal elections and cited evidence of non-citizens appearing on voter rolls in places such as Massachusetts, Ohio, and Virginia.

        “Due to the wide-open border that the Biden administration has refused to close, practically engineered to open, we now have so many non-citizens in the country that if only one out of 100 of those voted, they would cast hundreds of thousands of votes,” Johnson said.

        “Since our elections are so razor thin in these days that we're in—just a few precincts in a few states decide the makeup of Congress and who is elected to the White House—this is a dangerously high number and it is a great concern to millions and millions of Americans. It could obviously change the outcome of our elections,” he added.

        Johnson also mentioned that around 16 million illegal immigrants have arrived in the U.S. since President Joe Biden took office.

        Illegal immigrants are prohibited from voting in federal elections but there are not preventative measures in place to keep them from registering to vote, the speaker claimed.

        “If a nefarious actor wants to intervene in our elections, all they have to do is check a box on a form and sign their name. That’s it, that's all that's required,” Johnson added.

        While non-citizens are prohibited from voting in federal, state, and most local elections, California, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., allow non-citizens to vote in local elections.

        “The most fundamental thing you can do to destroy the rule of law and to destroy our republic is to undermine faith in elections and undermine integrity of elections by making it unclear as to who is voting and limiting our ability to know that only citizens are voting,” Roy said Wednesday.

        “It’s legislation that really ought to pass unanimously in both houses of Congress because the only reason to oppose this—that I can think of—would be if you are comfortable with or somehow want non-citizens to vote and non-citizens in some instances to influence the outcome of elections,” Lee said.

        Elon Musk made headlines by declaring that anyone opposed to requiring proof of citizenship to vote in U.S. elections is a “traitor.”

        Musk called out opponents of the legislation as “TRAITORS” and raised the hypothetical question of what the penalty for treason in the United States is.

        “Those who oppose this are traitors. All Caps: TRAITORS,” Musk stated. “What is the penalty for traitors again?”

        Arizona requires proof of citizenship to vote in state elections, but explicitly does not for federal elections. This is messed up. I will run this out, again. A form from Arizona’s AHCCCS (Medicaid office) very explicitly telling folks that if their citizenship status cannot be confirmed, no worries. We’ll make sure to send you a “federal-only” ballot.

        According to the U.S. Constitution, treasonous individuals must either be executed or serve a minimum of five years in jail. They will also never be allowed to hold office in the United States, and they will be fined at least $10,000.
